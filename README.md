# DEPRECATED

ButterKnife supports library projects starting with version [8.2.0](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-820-2016-07-10). No new development will be taking place on this fork.


Butter Fork
===========

![Logo](website/static/logo.png)

A fork of [Butter Fork](https://github.com/oguzbabaoglu/butterfork) that is a fork of [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) with support for Library projects (Solves the non-final id problem).

This change is incompatible with the current library and is therefore distributed under a different name. See the [Limitations](#limitations) and [Why Fork?](#why-fork) sections below.

Usage is identical apart from using 'B' instead of 'R'. The solution does not depend on reflection.

```java
@BindView(B.id.user) EditText username;
@BindView(B.id.pass) EditText password;
//..
ButterKnife.bind(this);
```

Download
----------

```groovy

buildscript {
  repositories {
    jcenter()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.neenbedankt.gradle.plugins:android-apt:1.8'
    classpath 'com.github.vignesh-s:butterfork-plugin:2.0.0'
  }
}

// It is important that the library apt plugin are applied before butterfork-plugin
apply plugin: 'com.android.library'
apply plugin: 'com.neenbedankt.android-apt'
apply plugin: 'com.github.vignesh-s.butterfork-plugin'

// No need to declare dependencies, this is handled by the plugin

```

How does it work?
-----------------

ButterKnife does not work with library projects because R fields are not final, and Java annotations **must** have final values.

ButterFork adds a `generateB` task right after `processResources` (task that generates R). `generateB` builds a B class containing all field names in the R class as final String values.
```java
public final class B {
  public static final class id {
    public static final String text_view = "example.R.id.text_view";
  }
  public static final class string {
    public static final String app_name = "example.R.string.app_name";
  }
}
```

Final String values from the generated B class are used in place of R values in the annotations.
```java
@BindView(B.id.text_view) TextView textView;
```

The processor reads these annotations and generates binder classes. ButterKnife uses the resolved int value from the R class, but ButterFork instead places a reference back to the R class inside the generated code.

**ButterKnife:** `view = finder.findRequiredView(source, 2131755092, "field 'textView'")`

**ButterFork:** `view = finder.findRequiredView(source, example.R.id.textView, "field 'textView'")`

Limitations
-----------
- Currently B is only generated for the 'local' R. To use R references from other libraries you need to use String literals like `@BindView("android.R.id.button1")`.

- B is only generated when gradle runs, whereas R is continually updated by the IDE. Rebuild the project to update it.

- Using String values means we lose the type-safety of the original library, the IDE will not warn you of typos or wrong references.

Why Fork?
---------------

There are a couple of issue threads where this problem was discussed for ButterKnife. In these you can find detailed explanations from Jake Wharton about why it is a bad idea to add this support to the existing library:
- [Issue #2](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/issues/2) - Add Support For Non-Final IDs
- [Issue #45](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/issues/45) - Library project issue
- [Issue #100](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/issues/100) - Injection does not work in library projects
- [Issue #123](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/issues/123) - take field/method name as default id
